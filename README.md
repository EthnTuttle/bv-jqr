## JQR Structure

### Section 100: Fundamentals
Basic Bitcoin and Freedom Tech knowledge requiring rote memorization:
- Bitcoin Basics (supply cap, halving, proof-of-work)
- Cryptographic Fundamentals (SHA-256, public/private keys)
- Austrian Economics Principles (sound money, time preference)
- Historical Context (monetary history, cypherpunk movement)

### Section 200: Systems and Technology
Understanding Bitcoin and Freedom Tech infrastructure:
- Bitcoin Network Operations (P2P networking, transaction propagation)
- Node Operations (full nodes, IBD, consensus rules)
- Self-Custody Systems (hot/cold storage, multisig, hardware wallets)
- DePIN Networks (Meshtastic, Bitaxe, satellite communications)
- Privacy and Security (coinjoins, Tor, OPSEC)

### Section 300: Practical Applications
Hands-on demonstrations and real-world skills:
- Node Deployment and Maintenance
- Self-Custody Implementation
- DePIN Network Participation
- Privacy and Operational Security
- Education and Advocacy
- Emergency Preparedness

### Section 400: Advanced Applications
Leadership and specialized skills:
- Technical Leadership (system design, security audits)
- Community Building (chapter establishment, conferences)
- Strategic Planning (organizational adoption, threat assessment)

## Qualification Levels

- **Basic Qualified**: Sections 100-200 complete (Fundamentals + Systems)
- **Journeyman**: Sections 100-300 complete (+ Practical Applications)  
- **Advanced**: Sections 100-400 complete (+ Leadership)
- **Master**: All sections + board approval from 5 Bitcoin Veterans

## Attestation System

### Signature Requirements
- Each JQR item requires signature from qualified SME
- SMEs must have valid bitcoinveterans.org NIP-05 verification
- Signatures are Nostr events with standardized format

### Event Structure
```json
{
  "kind": 31001,
  "content": "BV-JQR Attestation\nItem: 101.1 - State Bitcoin mission statement\nCandidate: npub1candidate...\nSME: npub1sme...\nDate: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\nNotes: Optional comments",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "bv-jqr-101.1-npub1candidate"],
    ["p", "npub1candidate"],
    ["jqr_item", "101.1"],
    ["jqr_section", "100"],
    ["authority", "bitcoinveterans.org"]
  ]
}
```

### Field Operations Support
- **Offline Attestation Creation** for remote training
- **Local Event Persistence** with cryptographic integrity
- **Batch Publishing** when network becomes available
- **Complete Audit Trail** maintained locally

## Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile application
- **Purplestack**: Nostr-enabled development framework
- **Riverpod**: State management and dependency injection
- **Purplebase**: Local-first Nostr SDK with relay pool
- **Models Package**: Domain models for Nostr events

### Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: User authenticates with Nostr keypair
2. **Authority Selection**: Choose JQR authority (NIP-05 domain)
3. **Progress Tracking**: Local storage of completion status
4. **Attestation**: SMEs sign completions via Nostr events
5. **Synchronization**: Real-time updates across network
6. **Verification**: Cryptographic validation of all signatures

### Offline Capability
- Complete JQR content cached locally
- Attestation events stored with full cryptographic proof
- Field operation support with deferred network sync
- Local verification without internet dependency

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK with FVM
- Android SDK for mobile development
